# Macro-Mancer: Financial AI Agent System

## Overview
**Macro-Mancer** is a sophisticated financial AI system that analyzes macroeconomic news and provides asset recommendations using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK). It combines news scraping, sentiment analysis, and machine learning to identify market opportunities.

ü§ñ Agent Pipeline

| Agent           | Purpose  |
|-----------------|---|
| news_fetcher    | Scrape RSS feeds	  |
| news_analyzer   | Sentiment analysis	 |
| db_saver        | Persist data	  |
| recommender     |  Generate recs	 |


## üßê Logic
The **Agent sequential team** aimed to do the followings:
- Fetch the latest business news from some feeds (used source: Yahoo Finance)
- Based on the articles it makes sentiment analysis, and categorize the 
  news into
   - news about specific ```asset(s)```
   - news about some asset classes/asset groups/ business areas (```scopes```)
   - ```macro news```
- While processing the news we also build an influence graph, that is, we 
  are searching for keywords(```scopes```), and operational locations, that describes the business of given assets or business areas. Using these we want to propagate impact of more general news (buiness areas and macro) to the tradeable assets.
- When evaluating assets we do the following:
   - we check what ```assets```  were mentioned, with what sentiments specific to each,
   - what asset ```scopes```  have been written about, with what sentiment,
   - what macro news did we find?

- We incorporate the freshness of sentiment scores, using an *exponential 
decay factor*.


- The sentiment scores of the two latter category (business areas and macro )
are propagated to the individual assets, using the ```location```of operation and the ```scopes```, that describe the assets.


üöÄ Usage Examples

**Basic Recommendation Request**

"Can you recommend me some financial assets based on the latest news?"
